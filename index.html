        <h3>HP Service Manager</h3>
        <p>One of the applications acquired by HP when it purchased Peregrine Systems in 2005. The application was originally known as PNMS (Peregrine Network Management System).

HP offers the application as a service desk solution that enables IT to work as a single organization, governed by a consistent set of processes to handle service delivery and support quickly and efficiently.</p>
